## Background

In Korea, many people overlook anniversaries unless they are national holidays. Recognizing the cultural importance of these occasions, I created KO:Theme to highlight the significance of Korean anniversaries and make them more meaningful. According to IGAWorks' 2019 report, KakaoTalk was the most used mobile application in Korea, with over 37.43 million users, making it an ideal platform to deliver content that raises awareness about these important dates.

## Features

- **Custom Themes for Anniversaries:** Each theme is specifically designed to represent a particular Korean anniversary, offering a brief explanation along with visual elements that reflect the meaning of the day.
- **Zodiac Characters:** The themes include Zodiac characters that change monthly, depending on the anniversary, adding an interactive and engaging element to keep users interested.
- **Illustrated Symbols:** Each anniversary is represented by symbols that are illustrated to reflect its importance, creating a strong visual connection for users.
